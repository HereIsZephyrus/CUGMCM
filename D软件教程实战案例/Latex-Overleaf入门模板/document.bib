 abstract={Latex surgical gloves may cause contact urticaria and serious allergic reactions in sensitized persons, but the frequency of this allergy is not known. In the present study, 512 hospital employees were screened with a latex-glove scratch-chamber test; 23 (4.5\%) were suspected and 15 (2.9\%) were proven allergic with latex prick and use tests. All of them were doctors and nurses, and 12 had had contact urticaria but no serious symptoms. They could continue their routine work using cotton or vinyl undergloves or special latex surgical gloves. Atopy, hand eczema and surgical work seemed to be predisposing factors. In operating units, 7.4\% of the doctors and 5.6\% of the nurses were allergic; the frequency was lower in non-operating units and among laboratory personnel. The high frequency of latex glove allergy, especially in operating units, focuses attention on the quality of surgical latex gloves.},

 abstract={The dynamics of two-dimensional ordering of micrometer-size polystyrene latex spheres on a horizontal glass substrate has been directly observed by means of optical microscopy. It turns out that the ordering starts when the thickness of the water layer containing particles becomes approximately equal to the particle diameter. By variation of the electrolyte concentration, the charge of the particles, and their volume fraction, it is proven that neither the electrostatic repulsion nor the van der Waals attraction between the particles is responsible for the formation of two-dimensional crystals. The direct observations revealed the main factors governing the ordering-the attractive capillary forces (due to the menisci formed around the particles) and the convective transport of particles toward the ordered region. The control of the water evaporation rate turns out to allow obtaining either well-ordered monolayers or well-ordered domains consisting of multilayers (bilayers, trilayers, etc.).},

  author={ Divincenzo, D. P. },

 abstract={A proof is given, which relies on the commutator algebra of the unitary Lie groups, that quantum gates operating on just two bits at a time are sufficient to construct a general quantum circuit. The best previous result had shown the universality of three-bit gates, by analogy to the universality of the Toffoli three-bit gate of classical reversible computing. Two-bit quantum gates may be implemented by magnetic resonance operations applied to a pair of electronic or nuclear spins. A "gearbox quantum computer " proposed here, based on the principles of atomic force microscopy, would permit the operation of such two-bit gates in a physical system with very long phase breaking (i.e., quantum phase coherence) times. Simpler versions of the gearbox computer could be used to do experiments on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states and related entangled quantum states.},

 abstract={— Non-ionic and carboxylated fluorescent polystyrene microspheres (100, 500 nm, 1 and 3 μm in diameter), were fed by gavage (2·5\% w/v; 1·25 mg kg1) daily for 10 days to female Sprague Dawley rats. Peyer's patches, villi, liver, lymph nodes and spleen of animals fed the non-ionic microspheres from 100 nm to 1 μm showed unequivocal evidence of uptake and translocation of the particles. Heart, kidney and lung showed no evidence of the presence of microspheres. Carboxylated microspheres were taken up to a lesser degree than the non-ionised particles. Experiments with 125I radiolabeled 100 nm and 1 μm particles showed a higher uptake of the smaller particles, which were concentrated in GI tissue and liver. Particles were not distributed randomly in the tissues, but were concentrated at the serosal side of the Peyer's patches and could be seen traversing the mesentery lymph vessels towards the lymph nodes. The results demonstrate a need to re-examine the possibilities of particulate oral delivery, as well as the potential toxicity of ingested particulates.},
