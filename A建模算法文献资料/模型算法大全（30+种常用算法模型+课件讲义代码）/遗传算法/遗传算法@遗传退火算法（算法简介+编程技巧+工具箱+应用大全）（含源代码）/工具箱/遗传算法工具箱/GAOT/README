This directory contains the Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox for
Matlab.

To use this, if you are local to NCSU and have AFS access to this
directory, simply extend the matlab path here.

>>path(path,'/afs/eos/info/ie589k_info/GAOT');

Otherwise, install the .m files into a directory named GAOT and extend
the matlab path to that directory.  The compressed tar archive and the
zip file should automatically create the GAOT directory for you.

The companion paper describing this toolbox is included here as
gaot.ps. This and the three demo files, gademo1.m gademo2.m gademo3.m,
should be sufficient explanation of this toolbox.  For any questions,
comments, suggestions send mail to jjoine@eos.ncsu.edu.

For a list of the files in the tool box get help on GAOT.

Thanks for trying the toolbox.
